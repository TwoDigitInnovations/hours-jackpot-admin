                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-10'>At Hours Jackpot App, our primary focus is on providing a unique platform for engaging in donations and
                    winning exciting prizes. While we value user convenience and strive to enhance the user experience,
                    we do not offer shipping and delivery services within our platform. Here's why this feature is
                    irrelevant to the functioning of the Hours Jackpot App:</p>
                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>1. <span className='font-bold'>Real-Time Donations</span>: Hours Jackpot App is centered around real-time donations tied to specific events, such
                    as scientific occurrences or quizzes related to those events. The essence of our platform is
                    participation, timing, and knowledge. We do not sell physical products or services that require
                    shipping or delivery. Users participate by purchasing tickets for donations, not physical items.</p>
                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>2. <span className='font-bold'>Digital Prizes</span>: The prizes users can win through Hours Jackpot App are digital in nature, such as cash rewards.
                    These prizes are typically credited directly to the user's account within the app, eliminating the need
                    for shipping or delivery. Our users do not receive physical goods or products as rewards.
                </p>
                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>3. <span className='font-bold'>Educational Mission</span>: A significant portion of the donations made through Hours Jackpot App goes towards
                    supporting schools and educational initiatives across the country. These donations are aimed at
                    fostering scientific knowledge and temper. The educational aspect of our platform further
                    emphasizes the non-physical nature of our offerings</p>
                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>4. <span className='font-bold'>Focus on Fairness</span>: Hours Jackpot App places a strong emphasis on fairness and transparency in prize
                    distribution. The real-time nature of our donations, tied to specific quiz questions and timing,
                    ensures a level playing field for all participants. Introducing shipping and delivery elements could
                    introduce complexity and potential disparities in the distribution process.
                </p>
                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>5. <span className='font-bold'>Simplified User Experience</span>: We have designed Hours Jackpot App to be user-friendly and straightforward,
                    with a clear focus on our core offerings. Adding shipping and delivery services would complicate the
                    user experience unnecessarily, potentially detracting from the platform's primary purpose.</p>
                <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>In summary, the Hours Jackpot App's core functionality revolves around real-time donations, scientific quizzes,
                    and digital prizes, making shipping and delivery services irrelevant to our platform's operation. Our
                    mission is to promote knowledge and scientific curiosity, and we are committed to delivering a
                    seamless and focused experience to our users. If you have any questions or require further
                    assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team. Thank you for being a part of the
                    Hours Jackpot App community</p>
