            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>At Hours Jackpot App, we strive to provide a transparent and engaging platform for our users to participate in
                exciting donations and stand a chance to win amazing prizes. We understand that sometimes
                circumstances may change, but we'd like to explain why our portal doesn't offer refunds or
                cancellations.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>1. <span className='font-bold'>Real-Time Nature of Donations</span>: Our donations are designed to be dynamic and time-sensitive,
                often tied to significant scientific events. To maintain fairness, we require users to purchase tickets
                precisely at specific times related to these events. This real-time nature of donations means that
                once a donation is made, it cannot be reversed or cancelled, as it could affect the integrity of the
                prize distribution process.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>2. <span className='font-bold'>Equal Opportunity for All</span>: We are committed to providing an equal opportunity for all users.
                Offering refunds or cancellations would create discrepancies and unfair advantages. Our prize
                distribution is based on precise timing and correct answers to science-related quiz questions. Any
                refunds or cancellations would disrupt this process and potentially disadvantage other participants.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>3. <span className='font-bold'>Supporting Our Mission</span>: A portion of the donations made through our platform goes towards
                supporting schools across the country. These donations are crucial for our mission of spreading
                knowledge and scientific temper. Refunds or cancellations would impact our ability to fulfil this
                commitment to education.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>4. <span className='font-bold'>User Responsibility</span>: We encourage users to carefully consider their participation in donations and
                ensure they can meet the specific time requirements before making a purchase. It's essential to
                calculate the time difference between their local time and UTC accurately. We provide clear
                information and tooltips to assist users in making informed decisions.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>5. <span className='font-bold'>KYC Verification</span>: In the event that a user wins a prize, we follow a KYC (Know Your Customer)
                verification process. This process includes verifying the user's identity and contact details. Refunds or
                cancellations could complicate this verification process and delay the distribution of winnings.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>6. <span className='font-bold'>Fair Distribution</span>: In cases where multiple users correctly answer quiz questions and purchase
                tickets at the exact time, the prize amount is evenly distributed among them. Refunds or
                cancellations would disrupt the fair distribution process we have in place.</p>
            <p className='text-md md:text-lg text-black mb-3'>We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but we hope you appreciate our
                commitment to maintaining fairness and transparency in the Hours Jackpot App platform. We encourage users
                to participate responsibly, knowing that their contributions are making a positive impact on
                education and scientific knowledge. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to
                reach out to our support team via the "Have Questions? Chat with Us" option on the app.</p>
